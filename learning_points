Points for learning

1. Need to practice the steps to create a repo on my local machine and generating the ssh keys as i found that quite tedious.
2. Also need to practice staging, commiting and pushing repos to github more
3. so far really enjoying the learning process.
4. Struggled in a few places when generating the ssh keys, especially when adding it, but now all resolved.
